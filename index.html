			<h2>My motivation for ICT</h2>
			<p>I usually have a hard time motivating myself to do something because if I don't like something I
				automatically don't have the motivation for it. I get distracted lose track etc. The reason I stared the
				ICT
				study program was because I remembered it being fun when I once did it at HZ. It sounds simple but
				thatâ€™s how it is, it's fun. Not only that when I did research, I realized that if I study ICT the
				chances of me getting a well-paid job were high because the demand for people aquatinted with ICT is
				high.

			<h2>Why does ICT fit me</h2>
			<p> The reason why the ICT study program fits me is because in the ICT field you get a lot of freedom when
				working on projects and you can express yourself. You get to create things using your creativity. This
				fits me because I like doing things my way and in my timeframe. A lot of freedom is always nice and
				helps with stress. Because of these things you still get to enjoy your job and keep things different.
				<br><br>
				ICT itself fits me well because when I did a course week at HZ, I realized I really liked programming
				and
				making something original. These past few days I have also realized that I actually really enjoyed the
				coding,
				out of school and in. The fact that I am making a code completely designed by me is what I like about it
				because I am in control everything about it. I enjoy knowing everything till in the very detail and I
				think coding something is the "blueprint" of so much which makes it really interesting for me.
